 UX challenge for interview

So, the project was not very difficult at first. I created the form and styled it but then ran into 'onblur'. I have never really used it before and it made things a bit more complex than I really had time to figure out completely. I had the toggleVisibility ready for the password, but once I added the 'onblur' it really got in the way of my method and I began to think I should have gone a different route in building it. Though there are a few things that could use some fine tuning if time permitted,  I am pleased with the outcome. I appreciate the opportunity to do this exercise.

**Update-
I ended up adding a JS file just to show the PasswordVisibilityToggle without the 'onblur' affecting it.
